=DEVELOPMENT GUIDE=

==Development Environment==

Install kune (see INSTALL file).

Running (in the trunk directory)

 mvn eclipse:eclipse 

generates .project and download necessary code jars. Then you can import the project in eclipse (File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace). 

Also you have to set the variable M2_REPO (Eclipse Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables > New) to the location of your local maven repo (in our case /home/ouruser/.m2/repository).

GWT Hosted Mode:

We have a "Run configuration" (Run > Open Run Dialog) in eclipse with Project: "org.ourproject.kune" with Main class: "com.google.gwt.dev.GWTShell", with this program arguments (or similar): "-noserver -out gwt-out /kune/?locale=en&log_level=INFO -port 8080" and in the "Classpath User Entries":
* gwt-dev-[linux|mac|windows].jar (Add External Jar and select it from your gwt installation directory)
* java - /kune/src/main
* kune (default classpath)

If you have memory problems running the hosted mode, increase it in VM arguments:
  -Xmx512M

before run hosted mode compile once with:
 mvn gwt:compile
and deploy with:
 script/deploy_gwt.sh 
and then we run jetty (with "script/server.sh" also you can run server in debug mode, see TROUBLESHOOT).

==Code preferences==

We use some eclipse code preferences for kune project:
 dev-utils/kune.cleanup.eclipse.preferences.xml
 dev-utils/kune.formatter.eclipse.preferences.xml
please use it if you want to contribute.

We will (try) to follow:
