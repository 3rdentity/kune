DEVELOPMENT GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install kune (see INSTALL file).

mvn eclipse:eclipse generates .project and download necessary code jars.

GWT Hosted Mode:

We have a "Run configuration" (Run > Open Run Dialog) in eclipse with Project: "org.ourproject.kune" with Main class: "com.google.gwt.dev.GWTShell", with this program arguments (or similar): "-noserver -out gwt-out /kune/?locale=en&log_level=INFO -port 8080" and in the "Classpath User Entries":
 - gwt-dev-[linux|mac|windows].jar
 - java - /org.ourproject.kune/src/main
 - org.ourproject.kune (default classpath)

before run hosted mode compile once with:
  mvn gwt:compile
and deploy with:
  script/deploy_gwt.sh 
and then we run jetty (with "mvn jetty:run" also you can run server in debug mode, see TROUBLESHOOT).

Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use some eclipse code preferences for kune project:
  dev-utils/kune.cleanup.eclipse.preferences.xml
  dev-utils/kune.formatter.eclipse.preferences.xml
please use it if you want to contribute.

We will (try) to follow:

and the code conventions for the JavaTM Programming Language:
