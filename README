= README of KUNE =

Kune is a free/open source federated collaborative social network, focused on collaboration rather than just in communication. That is, it focuses on online real-time collaborative editing (based on Apache Wave), decentralized social networking and web publishing, while focusing on workgroups rather than just in individuals. It aims to allow the creation of online spaces of collaborative work, where organizations and individuals can build projects online, coordinate common agendas, set up virtual meetings, publish in the web, and join organizations with similar interests. Kune is 100% free/libre software (AGPLv3), built with free/libre tools.
