== Adapting Kune to your site ==

Adapt as much as possible to your needs this files:

- src/main/resources/kune.properties 
- src/main/resources/wave-server.properties 
- src/main/resources/log4j.properties 
- src/main/webapp/ws.html

The last one is the home that you get at start-up and have some configurations also. You can change the html inside to your needs but follow the commentaries and try not to remove important parts that make kune to start.

Note: Remember that if you change this files in some point, you have to make 'mvn compile' so are copied to the target directoy.
