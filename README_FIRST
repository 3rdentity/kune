WARNING
Please note that we are doing a big refactorization of Kune to adapt it to Wave. Also we are starting to use other libraries (for instance gin for IoC instead of our old Suco library). Then don't expect to much of /trunk/ because of that (for our old more stable code see tag 0.0.6-pre-wiab).
