WARNING
Please note that we are doing a big refactorization of Kune to adapt it to Wave. Also we are starting to use other libraries (for instance gin for IoC instead of our old Suco library). Then maybe /trunk/ it's a litle bit inestable because of that (for our old more stable code see tag 0.0.6-pre-wiab). 

New code (and refactorized) is under cc.kune package. Our old code (not yet refactorized or deprecated) is under org.ourproject.kune package waiting for be adapted or removed.
