=TROUBLESHOOTING=

==Server debug==

Server: debug with jetty in eclipse:
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Debugging+with+the+Maven+Jetty+Plugin+inside+Eclipse

==Client debug==

Client code: you can debug with gwt hosted mode in eclipse (see DEV-GUIDE for hosted mode instructions).

==Firebug and client log levels==

To increase client logging add ?log_level=DEBUG# to the url and use firebug firefox extension to see the output.

==Emite troubleshooting==

See:

==Liquibase==

=== Checksum errors ===

Migration Failed: Validation Failed:1 change sets failed MD5Sum Check     src/main/resources/db/liquibase_changelog.xml :: 18 :: vjrj :: (MD5Sum: bde0aa519108e1e3d1f29bb2483bc9)

Don't try to update the liquibase changelogs you have already use. Better create new ones to delete, update, and so on. If you are developing and want to clear the checksums, you can use the command "clearCheckSums". See script/liquibase-* and http://www.liquibase.org/manual/command_line
