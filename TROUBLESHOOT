=TROUBLESHOOTING=

== Server debug ==

You can debug the server running from eclipse as external tool:
   'script/kune server via mvn with debug.launch'
and after this the debug launch:
   'script/kune server debug.launch'
that connects the debugger to the port 8001 of the running server.

Related: debug with jetty in eclipse:
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Debugging+with+the+Maven+Jetty+Plugin+inside+Eclipse

Also for different logging levels you can play with -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.util.log.DEBUG=true (or similars)

== Client debug ==

You can debug the client with the eclipse launch configuration 'script/kune client -no-server.launch'.

== Firebug and client log levels ==

To increase client logging add ?log_level=DEBUG# to the url and use firebug firefox extension to see the output.

== Emite troubleshooting ==

See:
http://code.google.com/p/emite/wiki/Troubleshooting

== Liquibase ==

=== Checksum errors ===

Migration Failed: Validation Failed:1 change sets failed MD5Sum Check     src/main/resources/db/liquibase_changelog.xml :: 18 :: vjrj :: (MD5Sum: bde0aa519108e1e3d1f29bb2483bc9)

Don't try to update the liquibase changelogs you have already use. Better create new ones to delete, update, and so on. If you are developing and want to clear the checksums, you can use the command "clearCheckSums". See script/liquibase-* and http://www.liquibase.org/manual/command_line

== Lucene ==

=== Indexes problems during upgrades ===

If you get errors like:

org.ourproject.kune.platf.server.ServerException: Error starting persistence service
(...)
Caused by: org.hibernate.search.SearchException: Unable to open IndexWriter for class org.ourproject.kune.platf.server.domain.User
(...)
Caused by: org.apache.lucene.index.CorruptIndexException: Unknown format version: -7

The indexes in /var/lib/kune/lucene/kune*/indexes/ are not compatible. For the moment the only workaround we now it's to delete the indexes.

Sometimes the tests also fails without any error (use the same workaround).

== JUnit ==

Running all the Kune test from eclipse I get connection pool exceptions like:
   Connections could not be acquired from the underlying database

We have problems testing all test together from eclipse and using real db (not the h2 memory db)

== Too many files open ==

If running all the Kune test you get errors about "Too many files open" see:
http://code.google.com/p/gwt-examples/wiki/gwtEclipseFaqs
about how to fix it in your system.

== Mysql: Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Access denied for user 'kune'@'localhost' (using password: YES) ==

Check that the password you have use in the database creation it's the same like the src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml. If it's wrong maybe you have to remove the mysql user (DROP USER) and repeat the GRANT senteces of the INSTALL.

If you have this problem with openfire it's not enough to change the password in openfire.xml because probably it's already stored in the ofProperty openfire table and you need to change the password there.

== Eclipse & GWT ==

If you have some tests with error like "can not be found in source packages. Check the inheritance chain from your module; it may not be inheriting a required module or a module may not be adding its source path entries properly" and you have installed GWTDesigner, uncheck "client classpath": http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/tools/gwtdesigner/preferences/gwt/preferences_builder.html

 Error: Invalid version number "2.0" passed to external.gwtOnLoad(), expected "2.1"; your hosted mode bootstrap file may be out of date; if you are using -noserver try recompiling and redeploying your app
 Fix: clear your browser cache

 Error: method should override method xxx (or similar)
 Fix: Project --> Properties --> Java Compiler ---> Uncheck enable project specific settings

 Error: Running Web application seems that are running an old GWT code
 Fix: Open Run > Run configurations and remove a recreate your launch configuration

 Error: Problem with Eclipse plugin and UiBinder "Field xxx has no corresponding field in template file yyy.ui.xml"
https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4353

== Too many GWT permutations? ==

Compile in PRETTY mode and edit target/kune-VERSION/ws/ws.nocache.js and look for 'unflattenKeylistIntoAnswers' to see a permutation list. See:
https://groups.google.com/group/google-web-toolkit/browse_thread/thread/ec7737c291ce4572/142590b8985b1b20?lnk=gst&q=user-agent+permutations#142590b8985b1b20

=== Outbound variable M2_REPO ===

Set M2_REPO to eclipse in Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variable (normally to /home/youruser/.m2/repository/)
