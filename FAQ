Q: I get the error: Caused by: org.ourproject.kune.chat.server.managers.ChatException: remote-server-not-found(404)
trying to create a room.

A: Check that the openfire server name is the same in the kune.properties file, and you can resolv the names :
  $ host yourhostname
and
  $ host rooms.yourhostname

Q: ERROR - Incorrect string value: '\xEF\xBF\xBD\xEF\xBF\xBD...' for column 'native_name' at row 1

A: Verify that your system supports UTF8 (in debian systems check /etc/locale.gen and locale-gen)
